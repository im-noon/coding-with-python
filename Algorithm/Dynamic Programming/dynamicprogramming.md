## Dynamic programming
-   Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem,
    by braking it down into a collection of simple sub-problem.
-   It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlaping sub-problems.
-   The method takes far as less time than other methods that don't take advantage of the sub-problem overlap.
-   We need to solve different part of the problem (sub-problem) + combine the solutions of the sub-problem to reach an
    overall solution.
-   We solve each sub-problem only once >> we reduce the number of computations.
-   Sub-problems can store (memorization)

#### Dynamic programming vs Divide and conquer:
    Several problem can solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlaping sub-problems.
    This stategy called "divide and conquer" method
-   Overlaping sub-problem -> dynamic programming
-   Non overlaping sub-problem -> divide and conquer method
