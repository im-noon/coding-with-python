## Backtracking:
- It is a form of recursion.
- General algorithm to finding all solutions of some 
  computational problems call "constrain satisfication problems"
- We incrementally build candidates to the solutions
- If partial candidate A cannot be completed to a valid solution:
  we abandon A as a solution
- For example: eight-queens problem or sudoku
